# Gov Date Adder

This is a chrome extension to add a button to each hidden element on the gov's job logging thing for universal credit. Im personally tired of typing in the same date each time I do job searching so I made this in like half an hour. Personally it should just be a feature on the site? Note, this is for the UK's government website for universal credit job logging. This is all very hard coded so it may be quite error prone. I wrote this for myself really but if you have a problem feel free to make an issue if you can or somehow notify me of whats wrong and ill add error handling and all that good stuff. 


## How to run

Download the source code and then go to chrome://extensions and then load unpacked. After this pick the GovDateAdder folder. Simple as that.
